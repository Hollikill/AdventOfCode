# Advent Of Code (2019)

These are all of my [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2019 solutions

Organized by Day, with both parts as a single or two files in a folder

## Days Completed

**1** - *Both*

**2** - *Both*

**3** - *Both*

**4** - *Both*

**5** - Working on *1*

## Other Files in Folders

Some of the files are from the subreddit, for double checking purposes only. They are named with a 'Test Against' on the end of the file.
